# POSTGRAPE

Postgrape allows developers to interact with a PostgreSQL database using JavaScript objects and classes, abstracting away SQL queries. It simplifies database operations by providing a higher-level API, enabling developers to work with database entities as if they were regular JavaScript objects, reducing boilerplate code and improving code maintainability.
